# AI-Powered Restaurant Chatbot - README
## Introduction
The AI-Powered Restaurant Chatbot, named "Andy," aims to enhance customer service in the restaurant industry. The chatbot is designed to provide customers with instant responses to their queries, enabling them to access information about menus, hours, prices, locations, and more, 24/7. Andy utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to improve its responses over time, catering to customer needs efficiently. This README provides an overview of the chatbot and its functionalities.

## Features
- **Language Support**: Andy offers support in both English and Arabic, catering to a wider range of customers and ensuring seamless communication.

- **Intent-Based Interaction**: Instead of comprehending user intent directly, Andy utilizes a tag system. By identifying tags associated with user queries, the chatbot selects appropriate responses, giving the illusion of understanding user intent.

- **Basic User Interaction**: The chatbot guides users to select their preferred language (1 for English, 2 for Arabic) and can engage in conversations, providing information and answering queries.

- **Error Handling**: If the chatbot doesn't understand a user query or encounters misspelled words, it prompts users to rephrase or correct their input.

- **Politeness and User Experience**: Andy maintains a courteous tone, prompting users to communicate appropriately. It avoids engaging with abusive, racist, or sexist language.

## How It Works
1. Users are prompted to choose their language (1 for English, 2 for Arabic).
2. The chatbot awaits user input and processes it using intent-based matching.
3. The input is tokenized, and relevant tags are identified.
4. Based on the identified tag, the chatbot generates responses associated with that tag. 
5. The selected response is provided to the user.

## Usage
1. Choose your preferred language by typing 1 for English or 2 for Arabic.
2. Engage in a conversation by typing queries or statements.
3. The chatbot will respond based on the identified tag and associated responses.
## Future Enhancements
- **Spelling Correction**: Implement natural language processing to recognize and correct misspelled words, enhancing the user experience.

- **Dialect Recognition**: Enhance Arabic dialect recognition to better understand regional expressions and slang terms.

- **Reservation System**: Add a feature to enable users to make reservations by providing date, seating, and location preferences.

- **Offer Suggestions**: Develop the ability to recommend offers based on customer preferences, creating a personalized experience.

- **User Identity Recognition**: Implement a feature to recognize user names and use them in the conversation, making interactions more user-friendly.
